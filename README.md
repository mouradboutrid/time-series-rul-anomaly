# Time Series RUL and Anomaly Detection

This project predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL), forecasts future RUL trends, and detects anomalies in time series data (e.g., CMAPSS).

## Features

- 🧠 RUL Prediction using LSTM/CNN-LSTM
- 🔮 RUL Forecasting using Seq2Seq or Transformer
- ⚠️ Anomaly Detection using Autoencoder or Isolation Forest
